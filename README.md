# long-input-self-learning

here 2 more arrays have been created to overcome the last problem of comming limmited inputs

this time 2 arrays have been created, which will store the value of input and other array will store the number of times it was called

now you can give an pattern up to 30 mins instead of 30 secs

then press the button with an output of 'F', and it will repeat the entrie process
